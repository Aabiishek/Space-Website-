        <p> <h2>About Us</h2>
            Welcome to our project for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, where we aim to unlock the hidden stories of our community through the power of geographic information systems (GIS) and open-source science datasets. Our goal is to explore how physical geography shapes critical issues that affect everyday life, from local infrastructure to environmental challenges like pollution or food deserts.
            By creatively modeling our community on an interactive map, we visualize data in new ways, merging NASA Earth observation data with local information to uncover trends and insights. Whether it’s the locations of key resources or the environmental impacts on public health, our project combines the power of technology with a deep connection to the place we call “home.”
        Through this platform, we aim to empower our community by making science accessible and showing how data can offer solutions to local issues. We invite you to explore, learn, and see your surroundings in a whole new light!
